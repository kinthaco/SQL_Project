# Database for an ecommerce site with auto pickup system

This project was undertaken to enhance my SQL querying skills using a fictional e-commerce company, which involved designing a relational database, performing queries with techniques like join, select and where, and exploring unstructured data management in MongoDB.

# **Goal**:

To develop a comprehensive database for an e-commerce retailer leveraging an automated stock-picking system. The database was designed to manage inventory, orders, suppliers, customers, and warehouses efficiently while providing actionable insights through SQL and MongoDB queries.

# **Process**:

**Defined** 
Business rules to establish relationships between entities (e.g., customers, orders, suppliers, warehouses).

**Designed**

Conceptual, logical, and physical entity-relationship diagrams to model the database structure.

**Created and populated**

Multiple tables, including Bin Card, Central Distribution Centre, Orders, and Warehouse, with dummy data.
Queried the database using SQL techniques such as JOIN, SELECT, WHERE, and HAVING to derive insights.

**Explored** 

MongoDB by creating collections for unstructured data and running queries to analyze key metrics.

# **Results**:
**Employee Insights**:

The database revealed that the average age of employees was 35 years, with 5 departments having distinct counts of employees.

**Customer Insights**:

SQL queries linked 50 orders to 30 customers, providing detailed purchase history and order details.

**Supplier and Product Insights**:

Identified 20 suppliers providing 100 distinct products, enabling analysis of supplier-product relationships.

**Warehouse Operations**: 

MongoDB queries filtered 3 warehouses with more than 350 employees and areas greater than 15,000 sqm.

**Inventory Efficiency**:

Projected details of 10 products priced above $30 using MongoDB queries for refined analysis.
