# Database for an ecommerce site with auto pickup system

This project was undertaken to enhance my SQL querying skills using a fictional e-commerce company, which involved designing a relational database, performing queries with techniques like join, select and where, and exploring unstructured data management in MongoDB.

# **Goal**:

To develop a comprehensive database for an e-commerce retailer leveraging an automated stock-picking system. The database was designed to manage inventory, orders, suppliers, customers, and warehouses efficiently while providing actionable insights through SQL and MongoDB queries.
